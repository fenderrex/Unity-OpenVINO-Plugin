# OpenVINO Plugin for Unity

![openvino-plugin-demo](openvino-plugin-demo.gif)



## Update - 12/6/2021

Added a new branch that contains an updated version of my initial project that enables the plugin to be used in the Unity Editor and removes the need to manually move files when building the project.

* [In-Editor Branch](https://github.com/cj-mills/Unity-OpenVINO-Plugin/tree/in-editor)



**Note:** Only GPU inference is enabled when using the Barracuda engine, due to performance constraints.
